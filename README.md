# Image Recognition with IBM Cloud Visual Recognition

## Project Overview

The "Image Recognition with IBM Cloud Visual Recognition" project is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use image recognition system. It allows users to upload images, and the system generates AI-generated captions for the recognized content. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for deployment, and details on how to navigate the website.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into four phases, each focusing on specific aspects:

1. **Phase 1: Problem Statement and Setup**
   - Outlines the project's objectives and sets up IBM Cloud Visual Recognition.

2. **Phase 2: Innovative Design and Solution Implementation**
   - Enhances the system with sentiment analysis, user engagement features, and performance optimization.

3. **Phase 3: Development**
   - Covers the technical implementation of the project, including setting up IBM Cloud, integrating Visual Recognition, and designing the web interface.

4. **Phase 4: Integration and Finalization**
   - Details the integration of IBM Cloud Visual Recognition, AI-generated caption generation, testing, and optimization.
